      <description>Built with Hugo and Codex theme.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently studying CS at Carnegie Mellon University. I got my start in computers through playing, and naturally wanting to make, video games. Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m working on a multiplayer platformer called Jumpers using Godot.
I also like learning languages. I&amp;rsquo;m a native English and Mandarin speaker, and I&amp;rsquo;m currently learning Swahili, Spanish, and Japanese. I&amp;rsquo;m always looking for more opportunities to practice!
My other interests include distance running, badminton, video editing, and SSBM.</description>
