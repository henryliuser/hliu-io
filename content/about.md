Hi, this is my website. It's still under construction. Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Codex](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-codex/) theme.


I'm currently studying Computer Science at UC Irvine. I got my start in computer science through game development. Right now, I'm working on a multiplayer platformer called Jumpers using Godot.

I also like learning languages. I'm a native English and Mandarin speaker, and I'm currently learning Swahili and Japanese. I took 3 years of Spanish in high school too, but I'm starting to forget it so I need to practice more.

My other interests include speedcubing, badminton, distance running, video editing, and SSBM.
