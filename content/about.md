![me](/assets/me.png "me")

Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Codex](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-codex/) theme.

I'm a 4th year studying CS at CMU.
My professional focus is in C++, systems programming, and parallel computing.

Additionally, I'm interested in competitive programming, computer microarchitecture, and game development.
I made a top 100 [submission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DaTsI42Wvo) to 3Blue1Brown's Summer of Math Exposition #2.
