I'm currently studying CS at Carnegie Mellon University. I got my start in computers through playing, and naturally wanting to make, video games. Right now, I'm working on a multiplayer platformer called Jumpers using Godot.

I also like learning languages. I'm a native English and Mandarin speaker, and I'm currently learning Swahili, Spanish, and Japanese. I'm always looking for more opportunities to practice!

My other interests include distance running, badminton, video editing, and SSBM.
