Hi, this is my website and it's still under construction.

I'm currently studying Computer Science at UC Irvine. I got my start in computer science through game dev. Right now, I'm working on a multiplayer platformer called Jumpers using Godot.

I also like learning languages. I'm a native English and Mandarin speaker, but I'm learning Swahili and Japanese at the moment. I also took 3 years of Spanish in high school, but I'm starting to forget it recently so I need to practice more.

My other interests include speedcubing, badminton, distance running, video editing, and SSBM.
